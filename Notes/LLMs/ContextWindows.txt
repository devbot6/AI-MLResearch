What is a Token?
- single unit of text
- typically a word or a character
- Tokenisation: the process of breaking down a piece of text into inddividual Token
- foundation step in pre-processing text for further analysis

Examples of Tokens:
- Word level example, "I need coffee before I write", would be ['I', 'need', 'coffee', 'before', 'I', 'write'].
- Punctuation or special chars example "Coffee is Life!!!" would be ['Coffee', 'is', 'life', '!', '!', '!'].
- Character-level tokens include individual characters instead of words. This is used in Natural Language Generation (NLG).
