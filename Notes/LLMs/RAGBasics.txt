RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

What is it?
- the process of optimizing the outpt of a large langauge model, so it references an authoritive knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response

How does it work?
- First the user prompts a question
- the retrieval model will then look into the knowledge base to search for relavant documents relating to the prompts
- it will then feed this information to the pre trained LLM
- then a response will be generated for the user

Why do this?
- it decreases halluciantions (lying) 
- it does this because the knowledge base is all true information and maintained
