LLMs

What do LLMs do?
LLMs are Large Language Models that take in text and return an intelligent answer. It can also finish sentences or make recommendations.

How do they Function?

    What are Vector Databases?
    - A vector database is a special database that is used to store vector data.
    - Often optimized to be output into a machine learning models especially LLMs
    
    What is a Vector in this context?
    - mathematical representation of the data
    - each vector has an array of numerical points to represent the data position
    
    Why use vector data rather than text data?
    - vector data is much easier for an LLM to process vs text data

    What does the LLM do with this vector data?
    - the model takes in text input
    - this input is then transformed into high-dimensional vector which represents the semantic and sytactic characteristics of the input text
    - this is called embedding, or the transformation of text data into vectors with numerical data 

    What does embedding use?
    - Embedding uses a nueral netowrk model called the Embedding Model to represent text in the embedding space

    Example:
    - the text "I Love Data Science"
    - if we represented this text using OpenAI model text-embedding 3-small would output a vector with 1536 demensions or:
    - [0.024739108979701996, -0.04105354845523834, 0.006121257785707712, -0.02210472710430622, 0.029098540544509888,...]
    - this number within the vector is the coordinate within the model's embedding space together this would form a unique representatioon of the sentence meaning
